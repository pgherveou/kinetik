## Middleware

Middleware provides a way to hook into the events and methods of a queue. The API is in
its infancy, but expect great things in the near future.

##### Current Middleware

- `environment` - start multiple queue runners based on environment variables
- `cli` - perform maintaince on your queue/jobs using a cli

##### Roadmap

This are the middleware "apps" that Kinetik currently has planned. If you are interested in
contributing, please contact [@jakeluer](http://twitter.com/jakeluer) on Twitter.

- HTTP API for job management
- Network capable event bus
- Web App UI
